# alx-project-0x01-setup

## Project Description
- This project is a comprehensive Next.js web application that demonstrates fundamental concepts of modern web development. The application features multiple pages for displaying posts and users, with interactive components for adding new content. Built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Next.js, the project showcases best practices in component-based architecture, state management, and API integration.

### Learning Objectives
*By completing this project, you will:*
* Set up a Next.js application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
* Implement dynamic page routing and navigation
* Create reusable React components with proper TypeScript typing
* Work with external APIs to fetch and display data
* Implement modal dialogs for user interaction
* Understand static site generation with getStaticProps
* Manage component state with React hooks
* Structure a project with proper directory organization
* Apply responsive design principles with Tailwind CSS

### Requirements
*Technical Requirements*
* Node.js (v16 or later)
* npm or yarn
* Next.js (latest version)
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS
* ESLint (for code quality)

### Functional Requirements
1. Base Application Setup
    * Create Next.js app with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint
    * Configure proper folder structure
    * Set up global CSS with Tailwind directives
2. Navigation System
    * Implement header with navigation links
    * Set up routing between home, posts, and users pages
    * Ensure navigation works without page reloads
3. Posts Functionality
    * Display posts from JSONPlaceholder API
    * Create PostCard component for displaying individual posts
    * Implement PostModal for adding new posts
    * Handle form submission and state management
4. Users Functionality
    * Display users from JSONPlaceholder API
    * Create UserCard component for displaying user information
    * Implement UserModal for adding new users
    * Handle complex nested data structures

### Best Practices
1. Component Architecture
    * Follow atomic design principles
    * Separate presentational and container components
    * Create reusable UI components (Button, Card, Modal)
2. Type Safety
    * Define proper TypeScript interfaces
    * Type all component props and state
    * Handle event types correctly
3. Styling
    * Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
    * Maintain consistent spacing and typography
    * Implement responsive design
4. State Management
    * Use React hooks for local state
    * Lift state up when necessary
    * Keep state minimal and focused
5. Project Structure
    * Organize components by feature/domain
    * Keep interfaces in a central location
    * Follow Next.js conventions for pages

### Implementation Notes
* The project uses JSONPlaceholder as a mock API
* Static generation (getStaticProps) is used for initial data fetching
* Modals demonstrate interactive UI patterns
* TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety throughout the application
* Tailwind CSS provides utility-first styling
